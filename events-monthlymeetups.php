        Every third Thursday of the month Open Nebraska meets up to discuss current activies, projects, and efforts. These meetings are open to public
        and we encourage anyone interested in open civic data, making their community better, code, or pizza and beer to come hang out.

        These meetups are held at Aviture Inc. (google maps link) through the end of 2014.
