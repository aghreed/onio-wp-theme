        This tool is was created out of necessity. There was no easy way to find out the inspection results of restaurants. 
        This tool will give you confidence youâ€™re eating at a safe and clean establishment. 
        Currently, the team is creating a map-based interface to see the results for many establishments in one area at a glance, with possibly an option 
        to pull in reviews from third party social sites such as Yelp, Foursquare, and Urbanspoon.
