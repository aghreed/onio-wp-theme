        We are working with local organizations to build an open source civic data library. 
        This library will be composed of all civic data sets Open Nebraska and others have gathered over the years. 
        This data portal will increase access to these data sets so that more developers and others can access the data directly.
        In the mean time, feel free to check out Open Nebraskaâ€™s repositories on Github.
