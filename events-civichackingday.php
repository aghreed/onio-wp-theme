        National Day of Civic Hacking (NDoCH) is an international event that takes place the first weekend in June in over 80 cities around the world.
         The event brings together citizens, software developers, and entrepreneurs to collaboratively create, build, and invent new solutions using publicly-released data, 
         code and technology to improve our communities and the governments that serve them. 
         Anyone can participate; you donâ€™t have to be an expert in technology, you just have to care about your neighborhood and community.
 
        In 2014, Open Nebraska will join brigades and organizations around the world in celebrating the NDoCH, with the first annual Community Tech Party in the Park (link).
