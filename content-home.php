	Open Nebraska is a civic innovation organization serving the citizens of the great state of Nebraska. Our mission is to solve community problems through civic application development, open data advocacy, and tech education. We aim to drive innovation and community engagement in Nebraska by making local information more accessible to the public.

	Open Nebraska is launching the first Code for America Brigade in the state -- a dual city Brigade for Omaha and Lincoln. It is our hope to expand our reach across the state over time through organizing and supporting CfA brigades in other Nebraska cities.
